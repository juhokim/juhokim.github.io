I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the [Institute for Systems Biology](https://isbscience.org/), mentored by [Prof. Ilya Shmulevich](https://shmulevich.isbscience.org/) and [Prof. Wei Wei](https://www.wei-lab.net/). I am also closely working with [Prof. Jim Heath](https://heath.isbscience.org/). My research interests lie in developing machine learning and artificial intelligence methods to address complex problems in healthcare and cancer. I recently focus on applying foundation models for images, natural languages, and genomics and developing deep learning algorithms to analyze digital pathology images (segmentation, detection), design a large language model system to better understand rare disease, and infer spatial and celluar insights from spatiotemporal multi-omics data. My another project includes to develop a better digital twin system for cancer patients by integrating physical systmes governed by ODEs or PDEs with neural networks.

Previously, I completed my Ph.D. in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://illinois.edu/). During my graduate study, I was advised by [Prof. Sanmi Koyejo](https://cs.stanford.edu/~sanmi/) and [Prof. Mohammed El-Kebir](https://www.el-kebir.net/). I was also closely working with [Prof. Nicholas Chia](https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/chia-nicholas-ph-d/bio-20087464) of [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayo.edu). Prior to joining the Ph.D. program, I obtained my M.S. degree from the same school working with [Prof. Jian Peng](https://jianpeng.web.engr.illinois.edu/) and my B.S. degree at [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/).
